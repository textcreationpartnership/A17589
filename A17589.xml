            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His words were godly, his workes and deedes heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, (for all his labours were in Gods Vine-yard.) Hee was the principall Shepheard of this little <hi>Arcadia:</hi> So by ſuch <hi>Arcadian</hi> paſturages, you may learne; how hee tendered his Flocke; in a worde, his life was anſwerable to that which be taught: A Preacher while hee liued vpon earth; and yet ſtill a Teacher whilſt his bodie lyeth in

Receiue then (moſt Noble Ladie) in protection theſe Divine ejaculations of the Soule, that your verie countenancing of them, may not onelie adde vnto their goodneſſe, but alſo may procure a good eſtimation amongſt many that are as religiouſlie affected as your ſelfe. They were of before knowne but to a few, now are they made legible to the world, they were once in hazard to bee loſt, but
<pb facs="tcp:16688:6"/> by mee they are enrolled to bee kept in the <hi>Printers Regiſter.</hi> But leaſt (being carefull to eſchew that deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vice of ingratitude, for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vn-deſerved favours) ſome thinke I may perchance fall in offence by the prolixitie of many idle wordes: I will therefore end, in commending my ſelfe vnder the aſſurance of your H. pardon, committing theſe heavenly meditations as moſt cordiall reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for the Soule to your daylie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as afore; and thus my good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your favourable cenſure, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes your Hon. not to think it amiſſe, althogh it agreeth not ſo much with my profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in reſpect of others more beſeeming, that I ſhould exhort your Ho. as you haue begun to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in your religious dueties, althogh I know it was not needfull for mee to remember you of thoſe things you haue

Now thus with due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the manifold kindneſſes <hi>I</hi> haue receiued, both from your ſelfe, and from my right Honourable good Lord &amp; Patron, <hi>I</hi> commit your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and your moſt Noble Familie to the mercifull protection of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie who mot without ceaſing multiplie his graces vpon you, and crowne you with all kind of bleſsings. The God of mercie and Father of Glorie (who hath abounded towardes you, not only in outward happineſſe of vnſtained Nobilitie; grandour, greatneſſe of

And now, what ſhall I render vnto thee for all thy ſpirituall and temporall bleſſinges thou haſt vouchſafed on mee? And what doth the Lord (my God) require of me, but to feare thee, to walke in all thy wayes, and to loue thee, and ſerue thee, with all mine heart, and with all my ſoule. Command mee (Lord) what thou wilt, and doe in mee that thou commandeſt. The moſt deteſtable vice is ingratitude, and greater honour can be giuen to none, than to bee called the Childe of God. Thou haſt the Son of thy delight, with whom thou mightſt haue contented thy ſelfe, and haſt thou not the holy Angels, which doe readily thy will, yet it hath pleaſed thee to adopt man-kinde. O ſuffer me not (holy Father) to degenerate from thee, and to turne to my former nature: Giue me an vnderſtanding heart, to doe thy

Thogh thou, euen thou my deare God, wold kill mee, yet will I truſt in thee, for I know thou canſt reviue me, and when thou woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt canſt heale mee.

For it is the greateſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can befall man, to forſake thy word, and admonitions, not to relye on thy promiſes, but harden the heart by obſtinacy and rebellion.
